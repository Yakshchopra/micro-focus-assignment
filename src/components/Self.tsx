        Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am Yaksh, a creative front-end web developer who values
        simplicity and awesomeness. I have an eye for design and am capable of
        translating beautiful designs into efficient code. As a self-taught
        developer, I enjoy delving deeply into code bases and coding my way
        through bugs. I'm proficient in React as well as possess some working
        knowledge of NodeJS and Express. I love talking about javaScript.
      </p>
      <p>Apart from coding I love doing the following things:</p>
      <div className='flex flex-wrap gap-3'>
        {interests.map((item: string, idx: number) => {
          return <Pill key={idx} text={item} />;
        })}
      </div>
      <p className='mt-5'>
        You can know more about me at:{' '}
