## Introduction

Greetings, I am Yaksh Chopra a frontend developer and a UI/UX designer. This is the repository for my submission for the recruitment assignment by Micro Focus. This contains a clean app which allows usser to fiddle around with some divs. I like to call this **Twiddle**.

## Features:

- Has a fixed height header and footer
- Has a cool timer
- Has radio button for positioning the floatable div
- Has a cool floatable dive that floats in the middle section(within constraints).
- Has a central section with a height of 400px
- Has a responsive design and works for both touch and mouse events.
- Has a page-2 with some stuff about me :)

And much more to explore ...
